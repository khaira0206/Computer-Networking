Ambedkar also analysed nationalism in the context of the demand of the Indian commercial community/class that sought to replace Europeans in the field of trade and commerce. They wanted to do so using the trope of nationalism. They also wanted lower exchange rates and higher profits in foreign trade by taking recourse to nationalism. Ambedkar critically observed such profit-seeking orientation of the commercial class and disapproved of their predatory economic pursuits under the garb of nationalism.

In 21st century India where the architecture of the economy is dominated by corporate and finance capital in alliance with the political formations championing the cause of so-called nationalism, it is extremely critical to recall the analysis of Ambedkar indicting the sole profit-making pursuits at the cost of people’s interests.In the present context.
